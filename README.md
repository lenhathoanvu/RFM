# RFM Analysis

## Overview
RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis is a marketing technique used to identify and categorize customers based on their purchasing behavior. The three key components of RFM analysis are:

- Recency: How recently a customer has made a purchase. Customers who recently purchased are more likely to buy again compared to those who haven't purchased in a while.

- Frequency: How often a customer makes a purchase within a specific time frame. Customers who purchase more frequently are generally more loyal and engaged.

- Monetary: The total amount of money a customer has spent. High-spending customers are often considered more valuable.

By scoring customers on each of these dimensions, businesses can segment their customer base, target marketing efforts more effectively, and ultimately increase customer retention and sales.
